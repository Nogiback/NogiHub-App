# NogiHub-App

[NodeJS - Social Media App - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-odin-book)

This is the FINAL CAPSTONE full stack project under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to create a fully functioning social media website. The application can be a clone of a popular social media site such as Facebook, X, or Threads. The application will be utilizing all the tools students have learned up to this point. Please see the project info in the link above.

For my application, I decided to make a lightweight clone of X (formerly known as Twitter). NogiHub allows you to create an account, edit your profile, create posts with images, follow other users, comment on user posts, and like user posts. The application should also be mobile friendly.

## Lessons Learned

Planning and not getting too ahead of yourself were the key lessons to take away from this project. While I did not utilize any new technologies, I definitely solidified my experience with creating full stack applications. A social media app was a great way to put everything together. I was very methodical and tried to plan how my app was going to work, look and feel well before diving into any code. I stayed patient throughout the process and tried not to let scope-creep bite me. I was able to implement features that I have not experimented with before such as infinite scrolling, search queries, and input debouncing. 

This concludes all the projects for The Odin Project. I am excited to take what I have learned and apply it to future work and personal projects!
